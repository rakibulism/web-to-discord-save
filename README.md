### Keyword System

Posts are automatically sent to the configured Discord channel with keyword tags. The extension extracts and categorizes posts based on the keywords you select, making it easy to organize your saved content.

## How It Works

1. **Post Detection**: The extension scans the page for social media posts using platform-specific selectors
2. **Data Extraction**: Extracts post title, description, author, media URLs, and post URL
3. **Keyword Selection**: User selects up to 2 keywords to categorize the post
4. **Channel Routing**: Posts are sent to channels based on keyword mappings
5. **Rich Embed**: Creates a beautiful Discord embed with all post information

## Data Extracted

For each saved post, the extension extracts:
- Post title/description
- Author name and profile URL
- Original post URL
- Media URLs (images, videos)
- Platform information
- Timestamp

## Privacy

- The extension only processes posts you explicitly choose to save
- No data is collected or stored by the extension
- All data is sent directly to your Discord server via webhook
- No third-party services are involved
